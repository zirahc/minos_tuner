# Minos Genomics Subnet – Architecture

Minos is a Bittensor subnet (SN107) that creates a decentralised market for genomic variant calling. Miners run variant-calling pipelines and are incentivized to maximize accuracy; validators independently reproduce and score results and set on-chain weights.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Genomic variant calling accuracy is critical for real-world genomics, yet benchmarking is fragmented and untrustworthy. Minos turns this into a continuous, incentivized benchmarking network:

- **Miners** run variant-calling pipelines (GATK, DeepVariant, or BCFtools — freebayes deprecated 2026-05-09 16:00 UTC) and earn rewards proportional to their accuracy.
- **Validators** re-run miner configurations against round truth data — held back while submissions are open and released publicly after the round closes — and score results with hap.py, so every result is independently reproducible.
- **The platform** generates synthetic benchmark BAMs (GIAB + HelixForge-inserted mutations) and coordinates rounds.

---

## 2. Round-Based Task Flow

Each scoring round follows this lifecycle:

```text
PLATFORM
  │  Creates round with: round_id, region (e.g. chr19:13M-23M, chr21:17M-22M),
  │  mutated BAM (presigned S3 URL), truth VCF (released after the round closes)
  │
  ▼ status: "pending"  (round created, waiting for start time)
  │
  ▼ status: "open"
MINERS
  │  Poll /v2/round-status → download BAM → run variant calling
  │  Submit: tool_name + tool_config (quality parameters only, no VCF)
  │
  ▼ status: "scoring"  (submission window closes)
VALIDATORS
  │  Poll /v2/get-scoring-rounds → get all miner submissions
  │  For each miner: re-run their exact tool_config → score VCF with hap.py
  │  Submit scores to platform → compute round weights → set weights on chain
  │
  ▼ status: "completed"
```

Key design choice: **miners submit configs, not VCFs**. Validators independently reproduce each miner's output. This makes scoring independently reproducible: a score comes from the validator's own run rather than from a submitted VCF.

## 3. Data Assets

| Pool | Contents | Visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference | GRCh38 FASTA + index + RTG SDF (chr1-chr22) | Public (downloaded by all) |
| Benchmark BAM | GIAB donors (HG001-HG007) 100-300× per chromosome, downsampled | Public (via platform presigned URL) |
| Truth VCF | GIAB + HelixForge-inserted synthetic mutations | Validators while submissions are open; released publicly after the round closes |
| Mutations-only VCF | Synthetic mutations only (no GIAB variants) | Validators while submissions are open (primary scoring scope); released publicly after the round closes |
| Confident BED | GIAB high-confidence regions per chromosome | Validators only (legacy GIAB-scoring support) |

Synthetic mutations are inserted using HelixForge at positions recorded in the mutations VCF. The SHA-256 of each round's BAM, truth VCF, and mutations VCF is published before the round is served (`GET /verification/task-window`), and the files themselves are released after the submission window closes (`GET /verification/round/{round_id}`), so any participant can verify what a round used and reproduce its scoring — see [docs/verification.md](verification.md). Validators require the **mutations-only VCF** (synthetic variants only) for current production scoring; if it is not provided, the validator skips the round instead of falling back to GIAB/BED-only scoring. The confident BED path remains in the code for legacy GIAB-only scoring support.

### Local file retention

Files written under `output/` are cleaned up by the running neuron: the miner removes subdirectories older than 4 hours, and the validator removes `output/mutated_bams`, `output/merged_truth` and `output/scoring` older than 5 hours (also once at startup). Copy anything you want to keep out of `output/`.

## 4. Miner Interface

Miners register on Bittensor and poll the platform for active rounds:

```json
POST /v2/round-status  →  {
  "round_id", "status", "region",
  "bam_presigned_url", "bam_index_presigned_url",
  "time_remaining_seconds"
}
```

On an active round, the miner:

1. Downloads the BAM (cached across rounds; digest handling described under [Download integrity](#download-integrity))
2. Runs its configured variant caller via Docker on the given region
3. Submits its tool config (quality parameters only — no VCF uploaded):

```json
POST /v2/submit-config  →  {
  "hotkey", "round_id", "tool_name", "tool_config",
  "variant_count", "runtime_seconds", "timestamp", "nonce", "signature",
  "config_commitment", "commitment_block", "config_nonce", "payment_proof"
}
```

All API calls are authenticated via canonical request signing. Each request includes a `signature` (the Bittensor keypair signs `METHOD|PATH|BODY_HASH|TIMESTAMP|NONCE`) and a unique `nonce` to prevent replay attacks. That `nonce` is the anti-replay
value for the request itself and is unrelated to `config_nonce`, which salts the
config commitment.

The last four fields are optional and each is **omitted from the body entirely when absent**, rather than sent as `null`, so the signed body is unchanged when they are not in use:

| Field | When it is sent | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config_commitment` | Only when the platform advertises `config_commitment_enabled: true` in `/scoring/network-config` | 64 hex chars: SHA-256 over domain, version, `netuid`, `round_id`, `hotkey`, `tool_name`, the nonce, and the canonical form of the *stripped* config. The same digest the miner publishes on chain, as `m1:<round8>:<commitment>` |
| `commitment_block` | Only when the height the commitment landed at is known | Block height read off the extrinsic receipt. Absent when the chain write was rate-limited or failed, or when the height could not be determined; the commitment itself is still submitted |
| `config_nonce` | With a commitment | The salt, revealed so the platform can recompute the digest. The config space is small enough to enumerate, so the commitment is salted |
| `payment_proof` | Only when this round's free submission allowance is used up and the extra submission was paid for | Proof of the TAO payment, from `utils/submission_payment.py` |

### Download integrity

The platform publishes a digest alongside each round file (`bam_sha256`, `truth_vcf_sha256`, `mutations_vcf_sha256`). Where one is published, a cached file is reused only if it matches, and a mismatching cache is discarded and re-downloaded.

Freshly downloaded bytes are checked against the same digest. Where a backup URL is configured, a mismatch on the primary defers to the backup before anything is accepted; if the backup does not produce a matching file either, the primary bytes are used and the mismatch is logged. Set `MINOS_ENFORCE_DOWNLOAD_SHA256` to `1`, `true`, `yes` or `on` to reject a mismatching download outright and fail the round instead — the stricter setting, and the one to use where a round must never be scored against unverified bytes. Files fetched without a published digest (the BAM index, for example) get an existence check only.

### Supported tools

| Template | Docker image |
| --- | --- |
| `gatk` | `broadinstitute/gatk:4.5.0.0` |
| `deepvariant` | `google/deepvariant:1.5.0` |
| `bcftools` | `quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.20--h8b25389_0` |
| `freebayes` | `staphb/freebayes:1.3.7` (DEPRECATED 2026-05-09; runner retained while in-flight pre-cutover rounds finish scoring, then removed in a follow-up release) |

Miners tune quality parameters via `configs/<tool>.conf`. Infrastructure parameters (`threads`, `memory_gb`, `timeout`, `ref_build`, `num_threads`) are stripped before submission and cannot influence scoring.

---

## 5. Validator Loop

Validators use **subset-based scoring** to scale across many miners. Instead of every validator scoring every miner (O(V×M)), the platform assigns each validator a primary miner range based on stake rank. Adjacent validators share a 20% overlap zone for integrity cross-checks.

```python
while True:
    rounds = get_scoring_rounds()              # poll platform for rounds in scoring phase
    for round in rounds:
        assignment = get_assignment(round)      # primary + secondary miner lists
        submissions = get_submissions(round)    # miner configs + presigned BAM/truth URLs
        download_round_files(round)             # BAM, truth VCF, mutations VCF

        # Per-job thread/memory and total concurrency are auto-tuned from
        # host CPU/RAM (see auto_scoring_config). Primaries run as a barrier;
        # secondaries are skipped if they'd start within 3 min of the deadline.
        with bounded_concurrency(N=auto):
            for miner in score_in_parallel(assignment.primary):
                submit_score(miner)             # per-miner score + artifact pointers
                update_round_score(miner.hotkey, miner.combined_final)
            if not approaching_deadline():
                for miner in score_in_parallel(assignment.secondary):
                    submit_score(miner)
                    update_round_score(miner.hotkey, miner.combined_final)

        # After scoring window closes: fetch peer scores for gap miners,
        # then record participation once using personal + backfilled hotkeys.
        backfill = get_backfill_scores(round)   # commit-then-reveal
        for entry in backfill:
            update_round_score(entry.hotkey, entry.score)
        record_round(personal_hotkeys + backfill_hotkeys)

        weights = compute_weights()             # winner-heavy pruning dust
        submit_weight_history(weights)          # platform dashboard/audit
        if registered_on_subnet:
            set_weights_on_chain(weights)       # Bittensor chain write
    sleep(query_interval)
```

Each `score_in_parallel(miners)` starts each miner's tool in its own Docker container under the auto-tuned semaphore, then scores the resulting VCF with hap.py and updates/submits that miner's score. The platform weight-history submission happens for registered and unregistered validators; on-chain `set_weights` only runs when the validator hotkey is registered on the subnet.

If the platform does not support assignments (e.g. single-validator testnet), the validator splits the round itself: it scores a head of `len(submissions) // <validators holding a permit>` miners as primary, then the remaining tail under the same deadline guard as secondary scoring — the tail is skipped when the scoring deadline is within 180s. Set `MINOS_FALLBACK_PRIMARY_N` to override the head size.

### 5.1 Scoring formula

hap.py computes SNP and INDEL precision/recall against the truth VCF, and the `AdvancedScorer` combines these into a final score (0–100).

The active scoring version is published in network configuration (`scoring_version` in `/scoring/network-config`) and applied consistently by validators; each validator resolves it once per round. **v1** is described below. **v2** is difficulty-weighted — `100 x (0.70 x core + 0.30 x germline)` behind a plausibility gate — and is a different scale, so scores from the two are not comparable. [docs/scoring.md](scoring.md) describes both in full.

v1 has four components:

| Component | Weight | What it measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core F1** | 60% | Truth-weighted F1 across SNPs and INDELs, with nonlinear emphasis (γ=0.5) rewarding near-perfect callers |
| **Completeness** | 15% | Average recall + coverage (1 − fraction unassessed) |
| **FP Rate** | 15% | Penalises excess false positives and call counts diverging from truth |
| **Quality** | 10% | Ti/Tv and Het/Hom ratio match against truth — rewards biologically consistent calls |

SNP/INDEL weighting is truth-count-proportional: `(f1_snp x truth_total_snp + f1_indel x truth_total_indel) / total_truth`. There is no fixed-ratio fallback — a round with no truth totals at all is scored 0 rather than reweighted.

### 5.2 Weight assignment (round-only winner-heavy pruning dust)

- Each scored round is ranked from that round's normalized AdvancedScorer result only; historical scores do not carry into winner selection
- Miners must participate in ≥ 5 of the last 20 rounds to be eligible for weights; the current round counts
- Miners below the participation threshold receive 0 weight
- Reward parameters come from `/scoring/network-config` — read the live values there. The shape is winner-heavy: the highest-scoring eligible current-round miner receives the `winner_weight` share, eligible ranks #2 through `dust_top_n` split the remainder as ranked pruning dust with `dust_decay` geometric decay, and `burn_rate` (plus any weight that cannot be assigned to an eligible miner) goes to burn
- Close current-round ties use deterministic submission/canonical-ranking signals so validators converge on the same winner

## 6. Result Integrity

| Mechanism | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| **Config re-execution** | Validators run the miner's tool independently, so a score comes from the validator's own run rather than from a submitted VCF |
| **Synthetic mutations** | HelixForge inserts mutations at positions not published in advance, so a public truth set alone does not cover the round |
| **Keypair authentication** | Every API call is signed with the Bittensor wallet keypair, so each submission is attributable to its hotkey |
| **Infrastructure parameters** | `threads`, `memory_gb`, `timeout`, `ref_build`, `num_threads` are host-specific and are removed from submitted configs, so scoring compares quality parameters only |
| **Winner-heavy rewards** | The top eligible miner receives the winner share (`winner_weight` in `/scoring/network-config`); eligible ranks below it receive pruning dust, so copied configs still need differentiated current-round performance |
| **Round verification** | After a round closes, Minos publishes the round-selection record, the committed file hashes, and the released round files; miner commitment fields are included when that feature is enabled — see [docs/verification.md](verification.md) |
